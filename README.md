# Commerce Sphere

**Commerce Sphere** is a e-commerce microservice ecosystem built using PHP. It is designed to provide scalable, flexible, and high-performance solutions for online stores. With microservices architecture at its core, each component operates autonomously, enabling easy integration, testing, and scaling.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: Each e-commerce function operates as an independent service, allowing for faster development cycles and improved fault isolation.
- **Scalability**: Effortlessly scale individual services to handle peak traffic, ensuring your store remains performant and reliable.
- **PHP-Based**: Powered by PHP's strengths, including its wide adoption, large community support, and vast ecosystem of libraries and tools.
- **Modular and Extensible**: Easily extend the ecosystem with custom-built services or third-party integrations, from customer reviews to inventory management.
- **Seamless Communication**: Microservices communicate through RESTful APIs, ensuring smooth data exchange and coordination between services.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- PHP 7.x or higher
- Composer
- Docker (for containerization of microservices)
- MySQL or PostgreSQL for database services

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chevp/commerce-sphere.git
   cd CommerceSphere
   ```

2. Install PHP dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your environment variables for database connections, API keys, etc.

4. Start the microservices:
   You can use Docker to run your microservices or run them individually.
   For Docker, use the following command to start the services:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

5. Access the system:
   The services should now be running. Access your e-commerce platform via `http://localhost` (or the relevant domain).
